第一篇　指导思想、主要目标和发展理念

“十三五”时期是全面建成小康社会决胜阶段。必须认真贯彻党中央战略决策和部署，准确把握国内外发展环境和条件的深刻变化，积极适应把握引领经济发展新常态，全面推进创新发展、协调发展、绿色发展、开放发展、共享发展，确保全面建成小康社会。

第一章　发展环境

“十二五”时期是我国发展很不平凡的五年。面对错综复杂的国际环境和艰巨繁重的国内改革发展稳定任务，党中央、国务院团结带领全国各族人民顽强拼搏、开拓创新，经济社会发展取得显著成就，胜利完成“十二五”规划确定的主要目标和任务。

积极应对国际金融危机持续影响等一系列重大风险挑战，适应经济发展新常态，不断创新和完善宏观调控，推动形成经济结构优化、发展动力转换、发展方式转变加快的良好态势。经济保持持续较快发展，经济总量稳居世界第二位，人均国内生产总值增至49351元（折合7924美元）。经济结构调整取得重大进展，农业稳定增长，第三产业增加值占国内生产总值比重超过第二产业，居民消费率不断提高，城乡区域差距趋于缩小，常住人口城镇化率达到56.1%，基础设施水平全面跃升，高技术产业、战略性新兴产业加快发展，一批重大科技成果达到世界先进水平。公共服务体系基本建立、覆盖面持续扩大，教育水平明显提升，全民健康状况明显改善，新增就业持续增加，贫困人口大幅减少，人民生活水平和质量进一步提高。生态文明建设取得新进展，主体功能区制度逐步健全，主要污染物排放持续减少，节能环保水平明显提升。全面深化改革有力推进，经济体制继续完善，人民民主不断扩大，依法治国开启新征程。全方位外交取得重大进展，国际地位显著提高，对外开放不断深入，成为全球第一货物贸易大国和主要对外投资大国，人民币纳入国际货币基金组织特别提款权货币篮子。中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦和社会主义核心价值观深入人心，国家文化软实力不断增强。中国特色军事变革成就显著，强军兴军迈出新步伐。全面从严治党开创新局面，党风廉政建设成效显著。我国经济实力、科技实力、国防实力、国际影响力又上了一个大台阶。

尤为重要的是，党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为总书记的党中央毫不动摇坚持和发展中国特色社会主义，勇于实践、善于创新，深化对共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律、人类社会发展规律的认识，形成一系列治国理政新理念新思想新战略，为在新的历史条件下深化改革开放、加快推进社会主义现代化提供了科学理论指导和行动指南。


“十三五”时期，国内外发展环境更加错综复杂。从国际看，和平与发展的时代主题没有变，世界多极化、经济全球化、文化多样化、社会信息化深入发展。国际金融危机冲击和深层次影响在相当长时期依然存在，世界经济在深度调整中曲折复苏、增长乏力。主要经济体走势和宏观政策取向分化，金融市场动荡不稳，大宗商品价格大幅波动，全球贸易持续低迷，贸易保护主义强化，新兴经济体困难和风险明显加大。新一轮科技革命和产业变革蓄势待发，国际能源格局发生重大调整。全球治理体系深刻变革，发展中国家群体力量继续增强，国际力量对比逐步趋向平衡，国际投资贸易规则体系加快重构，多边贸易体制受到区域性高标准自由贸易体制挑战。局部地区地缘博弈更加激烈，传统安全威胁和非传统安全威胁交织，国际关系复杂程度前所未有。外部环境不稳定不确定因素明显增多，我国发展面临的风险挑战加大。

从国内看，经济长期向好的基本面没有改变，发展前景依然广阔，但提质增效、转型升级的要求更加紧迫。经济发展进入新常态，向形态更高级、分工更优化、结构更合理阶段演化的趋势更加明显。消费升级加快，市场空间广阔，物质基础雄厚，产业体系完备，资金供给充裕，人力资本丰富，创新累积效应正在显现，综合优势依然显著。新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化深入发展，新的增长动力正在孕育形成，新的增长点、增长极、增长带不断成长壮大。全面深化改革和全面推进依法治国正释放新的动力、激发新的活力。同时，必须清醒认识到，发展方式粗放，不平衡、不协调、不可持续问题仍然突出，经济增速换挡、结构调整阵痛、动能转换困难相互交织，面临稳增长、调结构、防风险、惠民生等多重挑战。有效需求乏力和有效供给不足并存，结构性矛盾更加凸显，传统比较优势减弱，创新能力不强，经济下行压力加大，财政收支矛盾更加突出，金融风险隐患增大。农业基础依然薄弱，部分行业产能过剩严重，商品房库存过高，企业效益下滑，债务水平持续上升。城乡区域发展不平衡，空间开发粗放低效，资源约束趋紧，生态环境恶化趋势尚未得到根本扭转。基本公共服务供给仍然不足，收入差距较大，人口老龄化加快，消除贫困任务艰巨。重大安全事故频发，影响社会稳定因素增多，国民文明素质和社会文明程度有待提高，法治建设有待加强，维护社会和谐稳定难度加大。

综合判断，我国发展仍处于可以大有作为的重要战略机遇期，也面临诸多矛盾叠加、风险隐患增多的严峻挑战。必须准确把握战略机遇期内涵和条件的深刻变化，增强忧患意识、责任意识，强化底线思维，尊重规律与国情，积极适应把握引领新常态，坚持中国特色社会主义政治经济学的重要原则，坚持解放和发展社会生产力、坚持社会主义市场经济改革方向、坚持调动各方面积极性，坚定信心，迎难而上，继续集中力量办好自己的事情，着力在优化结构、增强动力、化解矛盾、补齐短板上取得突破，切实转变发展方式，提高发展质量和效益，努力跨越“中等收入陷阱”，不断开拓发展新境界。

第二章　指导思想

Title I. Guiding ideas, main objectives and development concepts

The “13th Five” period is the stage of the victory for the full realization of a small-comfort society. The Party's central strategic decision-making and deployment must be carefully implemented, with an accurate picture of the profound changes in the development environment and conditions, both within and outside the country, and with a view to adapting to the new normals that lead to economic development, with a view to fully advancing innovative development, coordinating development, green development, open development, shared development and ensuring the full realization of a small and prosperous society.

Chapter I Development environment

The twelfth five-year period was a remarkable five-year period for the development of our country. In the face of the complex international environment and the daunting task of domestic reform and stabilization, the central party and the State Council united to lead the nation's peoples to struggle hard and innovate, and to achieve significant achievements in economic and social development, successfully fulfilling the main objectives and tasks set out in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan.

Respond actively to a range of major risk challenges, such as the continuing impact of the international financial crisis, adapt to the new norm of economic development, continuously innovate and improve macro-regulation, and contribute to the emergence of a positive dynamic of economic structural optimization, a shift in development dynamics and an accelerated shift in development approaches. The economy continued to grow at a relatively rapid pace, with the economy remaining the second largest in the world, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) rising to $49,351 (equivalent to $7,924). Significant progress has been made in the restructuring of the economy, the steady growth of agriculture, the increase in the value added of the tertiary sector as a share of GDP over the secondary sector, rising consumption rates among the population, a narrowing of the urban-rural regional gap, a 56.1 per cent rate of urbanization of the resident population, an overall leap in infrastructure, accelerated growth in high-technology industries and strategic and emerging industries, and a number of major scientific and technological achievements at the world level. The public service system has been largely established and continuously expanded, with a marked improvement in the level of education, a marked improvement in the health status of the entire population, a steady increase in new employment, a significant reduction in the number of poor people and a further improvement in the standard of living and quality of life of the population. There has been new progress in the development of eco-civilization, a gradual improvement in the system of primary functional zones, a steady reduction in emissions of major pollutants and a marked increase in the level of energy conservation and environmental protection. Comprehensive and deeper reforms have been vigorously pursued, economic institutions have continued to improve, people's democracy has continued to expand, and a new journey is under way in a State governed by the rule of law. Significant progress has been made in all aspects of diplomacy, with a marked increase in international standing and increasing openness to the outside world, as the world's first major commodity-trading and major foreign investor, with the renminbi included in the basket of special drawing rights (SDRs) currencies of the International Monetary Fund. The core Chinese dream and socialist values of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation are deeply rooted in the hearts and minds of the Chinese people, and the country's cultural soft power is growing. The achievements of China's distinctive military transformation have been remarkable, and strong military forces have taken new steps. The party has achieved remarkable success in building integrity through a comprehensive process of innovation based on the rule of the party. Our economy, our scientific and technological power, our defence power and our international influence are on a great scale.

It is particularly important that, since the Party's eighteenth year, the central part of the party, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its Secretary-General, is unwavering in its commitment to and development of the socialism of the Chinese character, its courage to practise and innovate, and its understanding of the rules governing the Communist Party, the rules governing the construction of socialism and the rules governing the development of human society. The new strategy for the development of a new concept of governance has provided scientific and theoretical guidance and action guidance for the deepening of reforms and the acceleration of the modernization of socialism in the light of the new historical conditions.

During the “13th Five-Year” period, the internal and external development environment became more complex. Internationally, the theme of the era of peace and development has not changed and the world has become more multipolar, globalized, culturally diverse and socially informed. The impact and deep-seated effects of the international financial crisis have persisted for a long time, with the world economy recovering from deep adjustment and weak growth. Trends in major economies and the polarization of macro-policy orientations, volatility in financial markets, high commodity price volatility, continued depressed global trade, increased protectionism and a marked increase in difficulties and risks in emerging economies. A new science and technology revolution and industrial changes are on the rise, with major adjustments in the international energy landscape. The system of global governance had undergone profound changes, the mass forces of developing countries had continued to grow, international forces had gradually moved towards balance, the system of international investment trade rules had accelerated its re-engineering and the multilateral trading system had been challenged by regional high-standard free trade regimes. Local geo-portfolio games have become more intense, traditional security threats are intertwined with non-traditional security threats, and international relations are more complex than ever before. There has been a marked increase in instability and uncertainty in the external environment, as well as an increase in the risk challenges to our development.

Domestically, the long-term fundamentals of economic well-being have not changed and the prospects for development remain broad, but the demands for efficiency gains and upgrading of the transition have become even more pressing. Economic development has entered a new normal, with a trend towards more advanced forms, better division of labour and more structured stages of evolution becoming more evident. Consumption escalation is accelerating, markets are wide, the material base is large, industrial systems are adequate, financing is abundant, human capital is abundant, the cumulative effects of innovation are emerging, and the combined advantages remain significant. New industrialization, information, urbanization and modernization of agriculture have developed, and new growth dynamics are emerging, with new growth points, poles and growth growing. The overall deepening of reform and the overall advancement of a State governed by the rule of law are unleashing new momentum and dynamism. At the same time, it is important to recognize that the development approach is broad-based and that the problems of imbalance, disharmony and non-sustainability remain prominent, with economic growth stagnating, structural adjustment throes and kinetic energy conversion difficulties intertwined and facing multiple challenges such as steady growth, structural adjustment, risk prevention and welfare for all. The combination of weak and ineffective demand and inadequate supply, as well as structural contradictions, have accentuated by the erosion of traditional comparative advantages, weak capacity for innovation, increased downward pressure on the economy, greater fiscal balance-of-payments tensions and increased financial risk exposure. The agricultural base remains weak, with a high level of overcapacity in some sectors, overstocking of commodity houses, a decline in business efficiency and a steady rise in debt levels. The uneven development of urban and rural areas, the inefficient exploitation of space, the tightening of resource constraints and the deterioration of the ecological environment have yet to be fundamentally reversed. Access to basic public services remains inadequate, income disparities are large, population ageing is accelerating and the task of eradicating poverty is daunting. The frequency of major security incidents has increased factors affecting social stability, the quality of national and social civilization has yet to be improved, the rule of law has yet to be strengthened and the maintenance of social harmony and stability has become more difficult.

Taken together, our development is still in a period of important strategic opportunities where much can be done, and we also face serious challenges of increasing contradictions and risks. Deep changes in the content and conditions of the strategic opportunity period must be accurately grasped, awareness of distress and responsibility must be strengthened, bottom-line thinking must be strengthened, respect the norms and national circumstances must be respected, the new norm must be actively adapted, the important principles of socialist political economics must be adhered to in China, the emancipation and development of social productivity must be pursued, the reform of the socialist market economy must be carried out, the momentum must be mobilized, confidence-building efforts must continue, the efforts must continue to be concentrated on their own tasks, the efforts must be made to achieve breakthroughs in the optimization of structures, motivation, the resolution of contradictions and the alignment of short panels, the practical transformation of development approaches, the quality and effectiveness of development, and efforts to overcome the “middle-income trap” and the development of new horizons.

CHAPTER II. GUIDELINES

To promote the great banner of socialism in China, to fully implement the spirit of the Party's 18th and 18th Central, 4th and 5th plenary sessions, guided by Marxist Leninism, the Mao Zedong ideology, Deng Xiaoping's theory, the important ideas of the “three delegates” and the concept of scientific development, to pursue in depth the spirit of the important speech of the Xi Jinping Secretary-General's series, to insist on the full realization of a small and prosperous society, the comprehensive deepening of reform, the comprehensive rule of law, the comprehensive rule of law, the establishment of a ruling party's strategic layout, and the development of development as the first priority, to firmly establish and implement the concept of innovation, coordination, green, open and shared development, with a view to improving the quality and effectiveness of development, to expand the effective supply-side structural reforms, to meet the effective demand, to accelerate the development of institutional mechanisms and development modalities leading to economic development, to maintain strategic balance, to promote economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and party-building, to ensure the full realization of a small and prosperous society, and to provide a more solid basis for the realization of the second century and the great revival of the Chinese national dream.

The following principles must be observed:

- Adherence to the status of the people as the main subject. People are the fundamental force for development, and the realization of the fundamental interests of good, well-maintained and well-developed peoples is the fundamental purpose of development. The idea of people-centred development must be upheld, with the promotion of people's well-being and the promotion of comprehensive human development as the starting point and starting point for development, the development of people's democracy, the preservation of equity and justice in society, the guarantee of the right of people to equal participation and equal development, and the full mobilization of people's motivation, initiative and creativity.

- Adherence to scientific development. Development is a hard case, and it must be a scientific development. Our country is still in the early stages of socialism and will remain in its long-term state of affairs, as well as the main contradictions in society, which are the basic basis for the planning of development. It is important to maintain the focus on economic development, taking into account the new characteristics of development from a practical point of view, intensifying structural reforms and accelerating the transformation of economic development approaches towards higher-quality, more efficient, equitable and sustainable development.

- Stick to deepening the reforms. Reform is a powerful engine for development. In accordance with the general objective of perfecting and developing the socialist system of Chinese identity and promoting the modernization of the State's governance system and its capacity to govern, it is essential to improve the system of institutions that enable the market to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and to better perform the role of government, with a focus on the reform of the economic system, to speed up the improvement of all institutional mechanisms, to remove all obstacles to the development of science and to provide a sustained impetus for development.

— Adhering to the rule of law. The rule of law was a reliable guarantee of development. China's specialist socialist rule of law must be firmly and firmly pursued, the construction of the socialist rule of law system must be accelerated, the socialist rule of law State must be built, scientific legislation must be advanced, the law must be strictly enforced, justice must be fair and the rule of law must be respected by all, the construction of an economy based on the rule of law and a society based on the rule of law must be accelerated, and economic and social development must be placed on the path of the rule of law.

- Sticking to the integration of the two major national and international scenarios. Full-scale openness to the outside world is a necessary requirement for development. It is important to maintain the opening of national doors and to make full use of the country's resources, markets, institutions, etc., while at the same time focusing on the effects of domestic international economic linkages, to respond positively to changes in the external environment, to make better use of the two markets, the two resources and to promote mutually beneficial co-benefits and co-development.

- Hold on to the party leader. Party leadership is the greatest strength of the socialist system of Chinese identity and is a fundamental political guarantee for the sustained and healthy development of the economy and society. It is imperative that the demands of the party be implemented in a comprehensive manner, that the party be made more creative, cohesive and combative, that the party be continuously strengthened in terms of its ability to govern and its level of authority, and that we ensure that our development ships advance along the right course.

Chapter III Main objectives

The main objectives of economic and social development over the next five years, in line with the new goals for the full realization of a small and prosperous society, are:

- The economy has maintained a high rate of medium-to-medium growth. On the basis of greater development balance, inclusiveness and sustainability, GDP and per capita income in urban and rural areas had doubled by 2020 compared to 2010, while key economic indicators had been balanced and the quality and effectiveness of development had improved significantly. At the mid-to-high end, progress in the modernization of agriculture has been evident, the level of industrialization and information integration has increased further, advanced manufacturing and strategic emerging industries have accelerated, new industries have grown and the share of services has increased further.

China's characteristic modern military system is much better. There has been a marked increase in the institutionalization of the party.

Chapter IV. The concept of development

The achievement of development goals, the breaking of development challenges and the nurturing of development advantages require that new concepts of development, innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, be firmly established and implemented.

Innovation is the first driver of development. Innovation must be placed at the heart of the national development landscape, constantly promoting innovation in all its aspects, including theoretical innovation, institutional innovation, science, technology and innovation, and cultural innovation, so that innovation permeates all party and national efforts, and that innovation becomes the norm in society as a whole.

Coordination is an inherent requirement for sustained healthy development. China must take a firm view of the overall configuration of the socialist cause of speciality, deal correctly with important relations in development, focus on promoting coordinated development of urban and rural areas, promote coordinated economic and social development, promote new forms of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture, and focus on enhancing the country's soft power while increasing its overall development.

Green is a sine qua non for sustainable development and an important expression of the people's quest for a better life. It is essential to adhere to the basic State policy of saving resources and protecting the environment, to maintain sustainable development, to follow the path of productive development, living well and ecologically sound civilizational development, to accelerate the construction of resource-efficient, environmentally friendly societies, to form a new paradigm for the modernization of the harmonious development of people and nature, to advance the construction of a beautiful China and to make a new contribution to global ecological security.

Openness is the only way for a nation to flourish. In keeping with the trend towards deeper integration of our economy into the world economy, we must pursue a mutually beneficial, win-win, open strategy that adheres to the need for internal and external coordination, balance of exports and imports, for the introduction and movement of capital and technology, for the development of a higher-level open economy, for active participation in global economic governance and the supply of public goods, for the enhancement of our institutional voice in global economic governance and for the building of a broad community of interests.

Sharing is the essence of socialism in China. It is essential to insist on development for people, development depends on people, development results are shared by people, and more effective institutional arrangements are put in place to increase the sense of gain for all people in shared development, to increase the momentum for development, to strengthen people's solidarity and to make steady progress towards shared prosperity.

Adhering to innovative development, coordinated development, green development, open development and shared development is a profound change in the overall context of our development. The new concept of development, innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, which is an intrinsically linked confluence of the ideas, direction and focus of our development in the “13th Five” and beyond, must cut across the various areas of economic and social development of the “13th Five”.

Chapter V Development poles

Implementing the new development philosophy and adapting to the new norm that leads to economic development must be accompanied by a modest expansion of aggregate demand, with a focus on structural changes on the supply side, so that the supply capacity meets the needs of the growing, escalating and individualized physical, cultural and ecological environment of the population at large. Structural adjustment must be driven by a reform approach, greater market-based reform of key areas of focus, adjustment of distorted policies and institutional arrangements, improvement of fair competition, a favourable market environment and mechanisms, maximum microdynamics, optimization of factor allocation, promotion of industrial structural upgrading, expansion of efficient and medium- and high-end supply, increased adaptability and flexibility of supply structures, and increased full factor productivity. The objectives of improving the quality and efficiency of the supply system must be to implement macroeconomic policies that are sound, industrial policies sound, micro-policies active, reform policies sound and social policies underpinned by policy pillars that are capable of producing, deleveraging, decosting and scalding, to accelerate the development of new dynamic energy, to transform and upgrade traditional comparative advantages, to strengthen the foundations of the real economy and to promote overall improvements in the level of social productivity.
